    "This is a Machine Learning course, and not a programming course. However, you need to program in order to run Machine Learning algorithms. In this course, we use Python, one of the most popular programming languages today. It was released for the first time in 1990, but gained extreme popularity in the last 15 years, hand in hand with the increasing importance of the world wide web, big data and data science. We use **Python 3** in the course to make full use of the features of the latest generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of free literature about Python available that you can use for the course in addition to the lecture notes provided. Especially if you have difficulties understanding a particular concept, it is often a good idea to look at alternative explanations. Here are some links to useful Python online books:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Easy installation** The easiest (and recommended) way to get the required software is to install Anaconda. Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python and some other programming languages used in scientific applications. It runs on all major operating systems and provides a number of very useful tools for Python programming.\n",

    "2. Go to https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#open-nav-lin and follow the instructions how to start Spyder.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mac OS X: install Python via [Fink](https://www.finkproject.org/) or [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linux: install Python via [Apt](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt) or whichever package manager corresponds to your distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go for the manual option, make sure that you have numpy and matplotlib installed. You typically do this using [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Note that most of the instructions written in the labs for this course assume you are using Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Last-resort option** If you have (unresolvable) trouble with the installation of Anaconda on your device, you can use it also via UU’s MyWorkplace (https://myworkplace.uu.nl/). The app that you need to start is called “Spyder Anaconda3”."
