    "If you are not already familiar with regular expressions, **read the introduction to regular expressions in Jurafsky & Martin, section 2.1** (temporarily made [available online][1] by the authors). It is a very accessible general introduction, but does not discuss how to use regular expressions in Python. This is no accident: Regular expressions are widely available in programming languages, website search windows, and stand-alone programs.  In this tutorial, we practice on a specially designed website. The use of regular expressions in Python is covered in a separate Notebook.\n",
