All models were trained with different functionsets.

Model 1:
	Featureset: test_features
		# This featureset uses the sample given in the notebook by default. This means it has the following features:
		word: the word itself
		pos: the pos of the word itself
	Results:
		With N = 15806
		    IOB Accuracy:  90.1%%
			Precision:      0.0%%
			Recall:         0.0%%
			F-Measure:      0.0%%

Model 2:
	Featureset: features_prevnext
		# This featureset uses the 6 perfect features plus the next word and its features.
		word, pos
		capital: whether the first letter of the word is a capital (boolean)
		prevcapital: whether the first letter of the previous word is a capital (boolean)
		prevword: the previous word in the sentence
		prevpos: the pos of the previous word
		nextword: the next word
		nextpos: the pos of the next word
		nextcapital: whether the first letter of the next word is a capital (boolean)
	Results:
		With N = 15806
		    IOB Accuracy:  94.2%%
			Precision:     48.6%%
			Recall:        49.4%%
			F-Measure:     49.0%%
		
Model 3:
	Featureset: features_luka_countries
		# This featureset uses a list of countries from https://github.com/google/dspl/blob/master/samples/google/canonical/countries.csv
		word, pos, capital, prevcapital, prevword, prevpos
		in_loc_file: if the word is in the countries file
	Results:
		With N = 15806
			IOB Accuracy:  94.5%%
			Precision:     47.5%%
			Recall:        54.0%%
			F-Measure:     50.6%%
	
Model 4:
	Featureset: features_luka_names
		# This featureset uses a list of names found at https://www.meertens.knaw.nl/nvb/topnamen/provincie/Utrecht/2014
		word, pos, capital, prevcapital, prevword, prevpos
		in_loc_file: if the word is in the names file
	Results:
		With N = 15806
		    IOB Accuracy:  94.5%%
			Precision:     47.5%%
			Recall:        54.0%%
			F-Measure:     50.6%%

Model 5:
	Featureset: features_best
		# This is generally the best featureset, as given in the notebook as a striven for accuracy
		# Later featuresets are based on this one, with extra features
		word, pos, capital, prevcapital, prevword, prevpos
	Results:
		With N = 15806
			IOB Accuracy:  94.5%%
			Precision:     47.5%%
			Recall:        54.0%%
			F-Measure:     50.6%%
		
Model 6:
	Featureset: features_best_BV
		# Based on the features_best featureset, with a "BV" check implemented
		word, pos, capital, prevcapital, prevword, prevpos
		containsBV: if the next word is equal to "bv" or "b.v.", if so, this current word is probably a business (boolean)
	Results:
		With N = 15806
		
Model 7: 
	Featureset: features_luka_whole_bimbam
		# Uses the features_best set, plus all checklist variables
		# csv's used: 
			world-cities.csv (https://github.com/datasets/world-cities/blob/master/data/world-cities.csv)
			countries.csv (see previous reference)
			names.csv (see previous reference)
		word, pos, capital, prevcapital, prevword, prevpos
		name: if the word is a name (boolean)
		city: if the word is a city (boolean)
		country: if the word is a country (boolean)
	Results:
		With N = 15806
